🤖 AI & Rule-Based Logic
Gemini AI is used if ENABLE_AI=true and GOOGLE_API_KEY is valid.

If Gemini fails or is not configured, a rule-based extractor is used.

Location extraction includes schema.org parsing, heuristics, and known location matching.

Text processing is optimized for performance and clarity.
